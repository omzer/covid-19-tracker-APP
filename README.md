## What is this App
##### This is an App where you can follow all the updates regarding Coronavirus cases in Palestine, data is being retrieved from a website that is being monitored from the ministry of health in Palestine (Trusted).


## What is the App language
##### App supports two languages, Arabic and English. If your device language is Arabic, then the App will be presented in Arabic, otherwise, English will be presented. Attached screenshots are presented in English since most of my github profile visitors won't have any prior Arabic knowledge.

## When it will be released
##### Releasing Apps that are related to corona to the Play store is prohibited, only government officials can release these Apps through their official accounts, do you know someone how can help? please send a DM to me :)

## Can I contribute to the project
##### This project is open-sourced, if you have some experience working on flutter and have some idea that you'd like to implement please don't hesitate. Pull requests, suggestions and issues are more than welcome!

## Want to try it on your local machine
##### This App is built entirely on Flutter, which is a cross platform framework for developing Apps for both Android and iOS, you need to do couple of things before cloning this to your local machine, here's some links that will put you in the track:
